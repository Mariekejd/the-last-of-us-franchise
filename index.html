    <h2>Introduction:</h2>

        <p>The Last of Us is an action-adventure video game franchise created by <em>Naughty Dog</em> and <em>Sony Interactive Entertainment</em>. The series is set in a post-apocalyptic United States ravaged by cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated fungus in the genus Cordyceps. It follows several survivors, including <strong>Joel Miller</strong>, a smuggler who lost his daughter during the outbreak; <strong>Ellie Williams</strong>, a young girl who is <strong>immune</strong> to the infection; and <em>Abby</em>, a soldier who becomes involved in a conflict between her militia and a religious cult. The games use a third-person perspective in which the player fights against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures with firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth.</p>
        <p>Game director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann led the development of the first game, <a href="tlou1.html"><em>The Last of us</em></a>, which was released for <em>PlayStation 3</em> in June 2013. A downloadable content addition, <u>The Last of Us: Left Behind</u>, was released in February 2014 and follows Ellie and her best friend <em>Riley</em>. A remastered version, The Last of Us Remastered, was released for <em>PlayStation 4</em> in July 2014. Druckmann continued to lead the development of a sequel, <a href="tlou2.html"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a>, which was released for <em>PlayStation 4</em> in June 2020. A remake of the first game, titled The Last of Us Part I, was released for <em>PlayStation 5</em> in September 2022, and Windows in March 2023. An untitled multiplayer game is in development.</p>
        <p>The series has received critical acclaim and has won <em>numerous</em> awards, including several <strong>Game of the Year</strong> recognitions; the first game has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made, and the second won more than 320 Game of the Year awards. Games in the series are among the <strong>best-selling</strong> PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 games. As of January 2023, the franchise has sold over 37 million games worldwide. Strong sales and support of the series led to the franchise's expansion into other media, including a comic book in 2013, live show in 2014, television adaptation by HBO, haunted house by Universal Studios, and tabletop game by Themeborne in 2023, and an upcoming tabletop game by CMON.</p>
