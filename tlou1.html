    <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
        
        <p>Similar to the original game on <em>PlayStation 3</em> (and remastered for the PS4), The Last of Us Part I is an action-adventure game with survival horror elements, played from the third-person perspective. The game was rebuilt from the ground up using Naughty Dog's latest engine on the PS5, leveraging the leap in technology with its powerful hardware. The game implements modernized gameplay, improved controls and performance, and expanded accessibility options closer to that of 2020's The Last of Us Part II. Visual fidelity, effects, exploration, and combat have all been enhanced as well. The game will also support PS5 hardware features including 3D audio and the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers of the DualSense controller.</p>
