        <p>Ellie Williams is the <strong>central character</strong> of <em>The Last of Us series</em>.She serves as the <strong>protagonist</strong> of The Last of Us: American Dreams, the playable deuteragonist of <a href="tlou1.html"><em>The Last of us</em></a>, and the playable protagonist of both The Last of Us: Left Behind and <a href="tlou2.html"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a>.</p>
        <p>Ellie grew up as an orphan in the Boston quarantine zone and attended a military preparatory school, where she met and befriended <strong>Riley Abel</strong>. When Ellie was fourteen, the pair were <strong>both infected</strong> with the <em>Cordyceps brain infection</em>, where Ellie discovered she was <strong>immune</strong>. A <em>friend</em> of her mother's and the <em>leader</em> of the <strong>Fireflies, Marlene,</strong> believed that she was the <em>key</em> to reverse engineering a <em>vaccine</em>. Marlene tasked <strong>Joel Miller</strong>, a smuggler, with escorting Ellie outside of the QZ. The simple drop-off turned into a year-long journey across America, and the two eventually formed a <em>close</em> bond.</p>
        <p>Upon reaching the <strong>Fireflies</strong> in Salt Lake City, Joel learned that only <strong>killing</strong> Ellie could create the cure. <em>Refusing</em> to allow this, he <em>killed</em> the <strong>head</strong> surgeon and escaped with Ellie to settle down in Jackson, his brother's community in Wyoming. For the next four years, Ellie came to <em>resent</em> Joel for saving her life. In 2038, <strong>Abby Anderson</strong>, a former <em>Firefly</em> and the <strong>surgeon's daughter</strong>, <em>found and <strong>killed</strong> Joel</em>. Ellie vowed <strong><u>revenge</u></strong> and pursued Abby to Seattle. Her efforts were fruitless, leading her to retire on a farm with her girlfriend <em>Dina</em> and her son <em>JJ</em>. Unable to forgive Abby, Ellie abandoned her family and pursued her once again to Santa Barbara, only to spare Abby in the end. She returned to Jackson once more, <em>coming to terms with Joel's death and his decision to save her life.</em></p>
